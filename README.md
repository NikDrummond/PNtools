# PNtools
Collection of tools for the annalysis of connectomics data, specifically the EM reconstruction of neurons.
There is a focus on early olfcatory processing in _Drosophila_.

This toolbox is built to work with CATMAID and pymaid, more detals for which can be found here:

https://pymaid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Quick Install:

  `pip3 install git+git://github.com/NikDrummond/PNtools@master`

This toolbox is still in active development, and will include a broader range of modules in the future, including:

  - Statisitcal analysis of data using permutation based methods
  - Comparative neuron visualisation for matching between data sets
  - Simple modeling of projection neurons based on a range of olfactory inputs
