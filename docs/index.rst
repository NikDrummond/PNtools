PNtools is a custom built Python library for a range of data handling and processing tasks 
related to **neuron data** generated with `CATMAID <http://catmaid.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_.
PNtools is very much in active development, as I add features, so is a work in progress! 

It is a good idea to check for updates and changes regularly, and reinstall from source.

The package is built to work in line with `pymaid <https://pymaid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
Pymaid is an extensive library, and PNtools is intended to build on it's functionality. 

Pymaid is licensed under the GNU GPL v3+ license. The source code is hosted
at `Github <https://github.com/NikDrummond/PNtools>`_. Feedback, feature requests
and bug reports are very welcome  and if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to email:

Current:

* Handling neurons for ROI/neuropil/volume specific pruning
* Connectivity sampling of neurons
* Custom plotting

To Come:

* Simple Olfactory projection neuron modeling
* Statistical analysis for connectomics data
* Visual comparisons between different neurons, for matching between data sets
* MORE!
